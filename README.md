### `Gameplay`
Click the "Play" button to start the game.
The player's turn begins, and three dice are rolled simultaneously.
Each dice rotates randomly and displays a number from 1 to 6.
The sum of the numbers rolled by the player's dice is calculated and displayed.
The player's turn ends, and it's now the computer's turn.
The computer's turn follows the same steps as the player's turn.
Once both the player and the computer have finished rolling their dice, the total scores are compared.
If only the player or the computer reaches a total of 12 points, the game ends, and the winner is announced.

The game continues until one player reaches a score of 3 points.
